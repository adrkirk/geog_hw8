<h3>Through my map, I answer the question, "What is the relationship between areas of significant biodiversity and large forested regions
    In the Hudson River Estuary?" To answer this question, I used two datasets from the New York State Government website: one including
    22 landscape regions determined to have a high concentration of regional biodiversity, and the other including polygons of large contiguous
    forest areas whose size and natural condition are suitable for the mainenance of ecological processes and forest communities.

    The first geoprocessing tool I used was "Dissolve." Because the Hudson River, split into its upper, middle, and lower sections, was included
    as Signficant Biodiversity Areas (or SBAs), and therefore wouldn't stand out to viewers, I wanted to make its location clear and dissolve the 
    three regions of the river into one. Secondly, I used "Intersection" to create a new layer with regions of overlap between SBAs and large forest 
    blocks. This layer is clear and hatched in the map, allowing for the the intermediary color resulting from the overlap of the opaque forest block 
    and SBA layers show through, making the intersection clear to viewers.

    My map reveals that although large forest patches in the Hudson River Estuary typically support higher concentrations of biodiversity,
    high levels exist in more fragmented forests and other landcover types also.
