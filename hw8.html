<h3>I created a choropleth map illustrating the mean level of exposure to PM2.5, or inhalable particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, for each country in 2020. PM2.5 includes many different chemicals, and can be emitted by construction sites, unpaved roads,
    cars, fires, or powerplants. PM2.5 is a key indicator of pollution levels. The CSV dataset I used, downloaded from the
    Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, provided the data in micrgrams per meters squared. An obstacle I ran into while joining my datasets were discrepencies in country naming. In order to remedy this,
    I cleaned my CSV, making sure the country names matched the vector of the globe. I used the natural breaks ratio; in this case, it gave the clearest picture of the data, utilizing the full range of the gradient.
